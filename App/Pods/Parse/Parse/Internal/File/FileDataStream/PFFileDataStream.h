/**
 PFFileDataStream is an NSStream proxy which won't read the last byte of a file until the downlaod has finished.

 When downloading a file stream via `-[PFFile getDataDownloadStreamInBackground]`, we need to be able to read and write 
 to the same file on disk concurrently.
 
 NSInputStream closes itself as soon as it hits EOF, so this class wraps an underlying NSInputStream and stops the 
 stream from closing until after writing has finished.
